# 1 Introduction

For the second assignment - Introduction to Unit Testing - in SENG 438, we looked at different ways to develop unit tests for two different classes: org.jfree.data.DataUtilities and org.jfree.data.Range. Different methods that were introduced in lectures were exercised, such as boundary value testing and creating equivalent classes. In comparsion to our last assignment, we were a lot more familar with unit testing than the testing strategies used in assignment 1. Unit testing is a lot more straight-forward and thorough, as we test specific functionalities, inputs and expected outputs.
