# 1 Introduction

For the second assignment - Introduction to Unit Testing - in SENG 438, we looked at different ways to develop unit tests for two different classes: org.jfree.data.DataUtilities and org.jfree.data.Range. Different methods that were introduced in lectures were exercised, such as boundary value testing and creating equivalent classes. In comparsion to our last assignment, we were a lot more familar with unit testing than the testing strategies used in assignment 1. Unit testing is a lot more straight-forward and thorough, as we test specific functionalities, inputs and expected outputs.

# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

For org.jfree.data.DataUtilities:
In order to test the 5 different methods in the DataUtilities, I approached this testing scenario by creating test cases that might be most commonly used through the perspective of a user using the class.
For calculateColumnTotal:
Looking at the API specifications for this class, this method returns the sum of the values in one column of the supplied data table. With invalid input, a total of zero will be returned. In order to create test cases, I first did more obvious scenarios, like calculating the column total for positive, negative and mixed values for just two columns. I then tried calculating the column total for more than 2 columns. I then created test cases when the function returns an empty table, null data, or invalid data such as NaN values. The test cases created to use null and invalid data was to test if the expected exception that is specified in documentation is thrown or not.

For calculateRowTotal:
Similar to calculateColumnTotal, this method returns the sum of the values in one row of the supplied data table. With invalid input, a total of zero will be returned. To create test cases for this method, I repeated the same steps I followed when creating tests for calculateColumnTotal. I first did more obvious scenarios, like calculating the row total for positive, negative and mixed values for just two rows. I then tried calculating the row total for more than 2 rows. I then created test cases when the function returns an empty table, null data, or invalid data such as NaN values. The test cases created to use null and invalid data was to test if the expected exception that is specified in documentation is thrown or not.

For createNumberArray:
After browsing the API specifications for createNumberArray, this method is a bit different from the previous two arrays. This function is used to constructs an array of Number objects from an array of double primitives. Similar to the two methods above, I first created more obvious tests, by testing to see if the method worked when you created a number array with positive, negative, mixed or an empty values of doubles. Of course, in order to see if the InvalidParameterException is thrown or not, I created two test cases, one wear the arguments are null and another, where the arguments are NaN values.

For createNumberArray2D:
Similar to createNumberArray, I followed the same steps to create test cases, but this time for two-dimensional data. I created tests, again, to check if a 2D number array can be created by using positive, negative, mixed and empty array of data. I then checked to see if the InvalidParameterException gets thrown or not when you pass in a null table, or one with NaN values.

For getCumulativePercentages: 
Of course, I followed similar steps to the methods above to create test cases for getCumulativePercentages. I passed in a culmination of mixed, positive and and negative values to test how the method calculates the overall percentages, as well as testing what would happen if you were to pass empty data into KeyedValues. I also tested exception handling, passing in invalid data such as null or a NaN value to see if the appropriate exception was thrown or not.

For combine() method in Range:
For each of the combine methods, I tested using a wide variety of different ranges such as: testing for valid input, ranges with empty/null values, ranges with overlapping values, adjacent values, disjoint ranges, etc. Here we didn't necessarily need to create a mocking class as we can simply check if the lower and upper bound of the new Range is what is expected. To compare the values of the new Range with the expected range, .getLowerBound() as well as .getUpperBound() is required, so the results is dependent on whether those methods return the correct and expected values (whose methods can be tested as well).

For getLength() method in Range:
getLength simply returns the distance between the lower bound and upper bound of a range. Test cases were made for certain scenerios like: validinput, negative ranges, non-negative, etc. We simply compared the value returned from the getLength() method to the expected value.

For equals() method in Range: 
When I designed test cases for the equals() method in the Range class, I considered different scenarios where the method should return true or false. I addressed positive cases where two Range objects with the same range or references to the same object were expected to be considered equal. I also took into account negative scenarios to assess inequality between Range objects with different ranges or between a Range object and null. Boundary cases, such as adjacent ranges or partial overlaps, were also explored to ensure comprehensive testing. Additionally, I included exception tests to handle cases where null was passed as an argument. Lastly, I verified properties like reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity, and consistency to ensure the correctness and reliability of the equality comparison.

For hashCode() method in Range: 
In designing test cases for the hashCode() method in the Range class, I focused on validating the behavior of the hashing function. I considered positive scenarios to confirm that equal objects consistently produced the same hash code, while different objects generated distinct hash codes. I also examined negative cases to ensure that hashCode() did not return null. Boundary scenarios, such as ranges with minimum and maximum values or empty ranges, were investigated to cover a wide range of inputs. Additionally, I incorporated exception tests to handle cases where null was passed as an argument. Lastly, I checked the consistency of hash codes across multiple invocations to ensure the reliability and stability of the hashing function.

**For DataUtilitiesTest:**

For method calculateColumnTotal:

Test case #1: calculateColumnTotalForOnlyTwoValidValues()
Test case #2: calculateColumnTotalForMoreThanTwoValidValues()
Test case #3: calculateColumnTotalForPositiveValuesOnly()
Test case #4: calculateColumnTotalForNegativeValuesOnly()
Test case #5: calculateColumnTotalWithPositiveAndNegativeValues()
Test case #6: calculateColumnTotalForSumOfZero()
Test case #7: calculateColumnTotalForEmptyDataTable()

For the cases above, these tests focused on the possible different data types that are valid, that can be passed in by users. With these data types, the given method should be able to calculate the column total efficiently, as described by the API specifications.

Test case #8: calculateColumnTotalWithNullData()
Test case #9: calculateColumnTotalWithInvalidData()

For the 2 cases above, these test cases specifically tested exception handling, and when it should occur. According to the API specifications, an InvalidParameterException must be thrown when any invalid data is passed in, and within the test cases, I pass in both null data, as well as invalid values such as NaN.

For method calculateRowTotal:

Test case #1: calculateRowTotalForTwoValidValues()
Test case #2: calculateRowTotalForMoreThanTwoValidValues()
Test case #3: calculateRowTotalWithForTwoPositiveValues()
Test case #4: calculateRowTotalWithForTwoNegativeValues()
Test case #5: calculateRowTotalWithANegativeAndPositiveValue()
Test case #6: calculateRowTotalForSumOfZero()
Test case #7: calculateRowTotalForEmptyDataTable()

Similar to above, test cases 1-7 focus on different types of data being stored in a Values2D object, like testing two rows vs three rows, having positive, negative or mixed values, and even if its empty.

Test case #8: calculateRowTotalWithNullData()
Test case #9: calculateRowTotalWithInvalidData()

Test cases 8 and 9 focus on testing exception handling when null or invalid data is stored in a Values2D object.

For method createNumberArray:

Test case #1: createNumberArrayWithValidData()
Test case #2: createNumberArrayWithEmptyArray()
Test case #3: createNumberArrayWithPositiveValues()
Test case #4: createNumberArrayWithNegativeValues()
Test case #5: createNumberArrayWithMixedValues()

For test cases 1-5, I focused on creating arrays with numbers that were doubles, but were either all positive, negative or mixed, as well as testing to see what happens when an empty array is passed into the method.

Test case #6: createNumberArrayWithNullData()
Test case #7: createNumberArrayWithInvalidData()

For test case 6 and 7, I focused on testing exception handling, to see if the appropriate exception is thrown when you try to create a number array with null or invalid values like NaN and infinity.

For method createNumberArray2D:

Test case #1: createNumberArray2DWithValidPositiveData()
Test case #2: createNumberArray2DWithEmptyArray()
Test case #3: createNumberArray2DWithNegativeValues()
Test case #4: createNumberArray2DWithMixedValues()

For test cases 1-4, I focused on creating arrays with numbers that were doubles, but were either all positive, negative or mixed, as well as testing to see what happens when an empty array is passed into the method.

Test case #5: createNumberArray2DWithNullData()
Test case #6: createNumberArray2DWithInvalidData()

For test case 5 and 6, I focused on testing exception handling, to see if the appropriate exception is thrown when you try to create a number array with null or invalid values like NaN and infinity.

For method getCumulativePercentages:

Test case #1: getCumulativePercentagesWithValidPositiveInput()
Test case #2: getCumulativePercentagesWithValidNegativeInput()
Test case #3: getCumulativePercentagesWithMixedValues()
Test case #4: getCumulativePercentagesWithEmptyInput()
Test case #5: getCumulativePercentagesWithSingleElementInput()

As similar to developing test cases for the previous methods, I followed the same train of thought when developing test cases for getCumulativePercentages. I first focused on the different types of data that might be stored in the KeyedValues object, like positive, negative and mixed values. I also looked at two special cases: when there's only a single element in the object, and when its empty.

Test case #6: getCumulativePercentagesWithNullInput()
Test case #7: getCumulativePercentagesWithInvalidInputShouldThrowException()

For test cases 6 and 7, I focused on exception handling, to see if the appropriate exception is thrown or not.

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed
As there was a total of 20 test case designs, we evenly divided those designs by 4 and each member did 5 each. We paired up in groups of two to create the actual test cases and peer-reviewed the test cases each pair created with the other pair. Communication was also kept constant between all members of the team and the lab report was done evenly as well. For the demo, each member presented 2 test cases that were developed. 

# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned
As creating test cases using the Eclipse IDE was the first time for all of the members of our team, we found difficulty in figuring out how things work. In our classes, we normally just make sure a certain aspect of a function is working and we neglect to test every single scenerio. What we learned through this lab is that we should take a methodical approach when it comes to testing the limitations of a certain function as it is the most effective in finding outputs that are expected/unexpected. 

Another major difficulty that all of our members faced was the fact that we were unable to see how the method was written. Because of this, the problems of each method were not apparent and could only be found when testing every single scenerio that particular method would be called.

One last difficulty that we had was submission. It is not crystal clear on how we should package our submission as well as some instructions, but several assumptions were made.

# 6 Comments/feedback on the lab itself
3/4 of our members found problems when it came to the installation of the Eclipse IDE and adding external libraries. The tutorial images did not exactly match what we had on our screens. We managed through it and also realized that JUnit cases can be created on other tests. Would have been a plus to have tutorials on other IDEs though. 

We wish it also were a little bit more obvious on what to sumbit and how to submit it. It would be nice to be able to submit an additional pdf file instead of having all documentation on the md file.
